///   - total charge: total_charge_gas_units, matches `gas_used` in the on-chain `TransactionInfo`.
///     - gas charge for execution (CPU time): execution_gas_units
///     - gas charge for IO (storage random access): io_gas_units
///     - storage fee charge (storage space): storage_fee_octas, when included in total_charge, this number is converted to gas units according to the user specified gas unit price.
///   - storage deletion refund: storage_fee_refund_octas, this is not included in `gas_used` or `total_charge_gas_units`, the net charge / refund is calculated by total_charge_gas_units * gas_unit_price - storage_fee_refund_octas.
